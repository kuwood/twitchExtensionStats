// this module is responsible for two things:
// 1. calling the `.associate` method on all our models
// 2. exporting our models (after they've been assoiated)
//
// Any code that needs access to our models (so `app.js`
// and our tests) should import the models from this file,
// not from the individual models files. If you import
// models from the individual file, they won't have had
// `.associate` called on them.

// Any time you create a new model for an app, import it here
const {Extension} = require('./extension')

// All models you want to expose to other modules should go here
const db = {
	Extension
}

Object.keys(db).forEach(function(modelName) {
  if (db[modelName].associate) {
    db[modelName].associate(db)
  }
})

// the outside world should only get access to our models
// via this single `db` object.
module.exports = db
